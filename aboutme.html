                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Karsten Ritch-O'Reilly and I am currently a second year Software Engineering student at Western University. I'm passionate about learning and am constantly seeking out new challenges to push myself and expand my knowledge.</p>
                <p>As a student, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have given me hands-on experience with everything from design to prototyping to testing. I've also been involved in extracurricular activities such as the Western Ski and Snowboard Club, and intramural hockey which have allowed me to develop my leadership and teamwork skills while maintaining a balanced lifestyle.</p>
                <p>My ultimate goal is to continue challenging myself and learn as much as I can, both in school and in my future career. Whether it's through taking on difficult projects or seeking out mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals, I'm always looking for ways to grow and develop my skills.</p>
                <p>If you're looking for a passionate and dedicated student with a love for learning, I would love to connect and explore potential opportunities to work together. Please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
